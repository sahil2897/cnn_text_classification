# cnn_text_classification
In this notebook, I have used CNN to do multiclass classification.

The data used was downloaded from   https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

I have used pretrained word embeddings. You can get it from   http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip

Here In this dataset, the more than 1 labels can be correct for a particular comment.
